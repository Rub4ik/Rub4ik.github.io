üíª Local Setup & Development
To get a local copy of this portfolio up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You will need Git installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rub4ik/Rub4ik.github.io.git

Navigate into the project directory:

cd Rub4ik.github.io

Running Locally
This is a static website, so you don't need a complex server setup. You can open the index.html file directly in your browser.

However, for a better development experience (especially if you plan to add more complex features or use a local Tailwind build process), it's recommended to use a simple local server.

Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server Extension
If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey. Then, right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server."

Option 2: Using Python's Simple HTTP Server
If you have Python installed, you can run a simple HTTP server from your terminal:

python -m http.server
# Or for Python 2:
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or the port indicated by the server).

üé® Customization
This portfolio is designed to be easily customizable to fit your personal brand and content.

Update Personal Information:

Open index.html.

Change the text in the Hero and About Me sections to reflect your professional story, skills, and aspirations.

Update the mailto: link and social media links in the Contact section with your actual details.

Replace your.email@example.com and linkedin.com/in/yourprofile placeholders.

Replace Images & Resume:

Place your professional headshot as images/profile.jpg.

Create compelling screenshots/thumbnails for your projects (e.g., images/discord-ai-bot-thumb.png, images/telegram-ai-bot-thumb.png, images/py-tg-bot-template-thumb.png) and place them in the images/ folder. Ensure consistent aspect ratios for a clean grid.

Add a suitable image for social media sharing as images/social-share-image.jpg (recommended: 1200x630px).

Place your updated CV/Resume as resume/rub4ik-resume.pdf.

Update any image paths in index.html if your filenames differ.

Modify Skills:

In the Skills section of index.html, update the <li> items under each category (Frontend, Backend, Tools & Other) to accurately list your proficiencies.

Add/Remove Projects:

In the Projects section of index.html, you can easily add new projects by copying an existing <div class="bg-white rounded-xl ..."> block and updating its content (image, title, description, technologies, and links).

Remove any project blocks you don't need.

Adjust Styling:

Most styling is handled by Tailwind CSS classes directly in index.html. You can modify these classes to change colors, spacing, typography, etc.

For custom CSS or overrides, edit css/style.css.

To change the primary color scheme, look for Tailwind classes like bg-blue-700, to-blue-900, text-yellow-300, etc., and replace them with your desired color palette.
